Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I talked with Giselle Sanchez when we were first looking over the project and discussed ways to use the scanner, and I talked with Janna Gilleman when I was having trouble with the scanner using the enter entered after the number of rounds as the "next line entered." We also talked about different ways to format our if/for statements.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
TA hours on Saturday 9/25/22 at 8pm
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I have some experience with Java from high school, and I like the process of compiling and running a file better than imperative programming. Besides that, it seems similar to Python in terms of syntax and possible uses. Java gave me more useful warnings, including some concerned with resource usage.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Boolean logic and variables are important in both languages, which makes sense because making decisions and storing information are basic tasks for computer programs written in almost any language. However, the specifics of dealing with these procedures seem to be dependent on the language. Also, Java seems to prioritize efficient resource usage more than Python, so the importance of those factors could vary signifcantly between languages.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I worked on this project in a couple sessions over the course of a few days. Having time to first make a working program, then come back to it to add additionally functionality made this project feel more achievable. I also appreciated the chance to think about problems on my own before asking for help from classmates or TAs. 

I started using many if statements, one after another, without realizing that I was overwriting my substitutions with each new substitution. I also ran into difficulties with "I" being replaced with "i" instead of "you" because I forgot that I converted the user input to lowercase and therefore no string ever contained an uppercase I. When I started having major trouble, I went back to my main branch and manually traced the code. Attempting to solve bugs without writing on paper made me spend more time than I needed.
